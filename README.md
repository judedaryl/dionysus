# Dionysus Project

A home theater hobby project as Plex / Kodi / Emby didn't really work out for me. The aim of the project is to provide a
local media library of movies / shows that can be populated from a local drive (more importantly an external hard drive).

This contains the server, the UI will be on a different project.

The name isn't final, will change once i have a better one. ( By default I either use greek god names or japanese sword names )
